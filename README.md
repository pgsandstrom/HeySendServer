HeySend Server
=========

A service for pushing content from your browser to your phone. In the future, the pushing might happen in any crazy direction!

Current status
--------------

Working, but crappy. The code is dirty as fudge.

Why I did this
--------------

I want to learn javascript and node.js. Also, I think HeySend could become cool.
